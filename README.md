A react app to quickly assign credit to contributors by using the **[Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT)](https://credit.niso.org/)**

## Features

## Why?

- I couldn't find a simple tool to generate CRediT contribution statements, so I made my own.
- I've always been curious about how people make interactive apps.
- It's fun to learn new things by doing.
